# Examination System Project 2025


The Examination System project is designed to provide a unified platform for managing student academic records, assessments, certifications, and employment readiness. The roadmap outlines each critical step required to build a robust, scalable system for educational institutions and HR departments alike, ensuring data consistency, analytical capability, and real-time insights across the entire student lifecycle.
This roadmap covers the entire Smart Examination System: OLTP design, Data Warehouse & HR Data Mart, SSRS reports, Power BI dashboards, and a Streamlit-based BI chatbot for querying the data warehouse using natural language in English and Arabic.
It serves as a comprehensive guide for all stakeholders involved — from database architects to business analysts and Power BI developers — offering a clear path from raw data collection to actionable dashboards.

# Scope
This roadmap covers:
•  Designing the conceptual and logical data model (ERD)
•  Creating a fully normalized transactional database using SQL Server
•  Populating the database with realistic sample data
•  Building a Data Warehouse using dimensional modeling
•  Creating an HR-specific Data Mart
•  Implementing ETL processes using SSIS
•  Designing SSRS reports using stored procedures and deploying them in Power BI Desktop.
•  Creating Power BI dashboards for Student, Instructor, Admin, and HR users with advanced DAX analytics for each.
•  A Streamlit-based BI chatbot for querying the data warehouse using natural language.


# Importance
This roadmap is central to achieving:
•  Data consistency: Clean, validated, and integrated data across all departments
•  Performance insights: From student readiness to hiring metrics
•  Data-driven decisions: For academic improvements and HR planning
•  Scalability: Easily adaptable to new departments, tracks, or recruitment partners

This system enables institutions to analyze student performance, manage certifications, assess job readiness, and respond to employer feedback. The inclusion of an Arabic-English chatbot improves accessibility for non-technical users.
By building a full analytical system on top of a stable OLTP foundation, the organization ensures not only operational efficiency but also long-term strategic visibility into student success and market alignment.
